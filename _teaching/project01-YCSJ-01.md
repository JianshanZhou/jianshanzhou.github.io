**Project Leader** established the overall project proposal motivated by biological intelligence, proposed the research goal, approach and plan, and managed the research progress with respect to theoretical modeling, algorithm prototype and performance evaluation of a novel adaptive bio-inspired network selection method for Quality-of-Service (QoS)-support vehicular applications in heterogeneous wireless networks.

Detailed contributions include:

+ Identified the adaptability and robustness in the response of cellular gene regulatory networks to dynamic and stochastic environmental conditions and motivated by the cellular adaptive behavior to propose a stochastic nonlinear dynamic system model, called extended attractor selection model (EASM), to describe the dynamics of attractor selection in the system state space.
+ Mapped the problem of network selection and accessing in a heterogeneous environment to the decision-making problem of distributed agents who aim to maximize the utilization benefit and allocation fairness of heterogeneous network resources in a global sense.
+ Developed an adaptive network selection framework based on the bio-inspired attractor selection model, implemented the bio-inspired decision-making algorithm and conducted extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.
