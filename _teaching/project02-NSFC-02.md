**Student Member** participating in the establishment of the overall project proposal, and engaged in adapting cell-level biological mechanisms to develop innovative decision-making methods for complex adaptive systems (such as an urban traffic network) in which agents are driven by certain biological intelligence to self-organize in a distributed manner, effectively utilize constrained resources by collaborative intelligence and co-evolve to a global efficient equilibirum.

Detailed contributions include:

+ Indentified the analogy between cells and signal controllers at those traffic intersections in a dynamic traffic network in terms of constrained decision-making behavior and mapped the problem of traffic signal control to the formulation of the response of a cellular gene network to a varying environment.
+ Proposed an adaptive traffic signal control framework that incoporates the adaptive and robust mechanism governing the dynamics of the stable gene expression in cells, called cellular attractor selection, into the signal operations of each individual controller to realize a globally self-adaptive traffic network regardless of stochastic and time-varying traffic load on each link.
+ Conducted simulation experiments to demonstrate the advantage and effectiveness of the adaptive attractor selection-based control formation in terms of system adaptability and efficiency, which provides an understanding of the potential of the bio-inspired intelligence in the design of complex adaptive systems and stochastic optimization.
