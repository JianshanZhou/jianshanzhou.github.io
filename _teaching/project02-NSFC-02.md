**Key Student Member** established the overall project proposal motivated by micro-level biological intelligence, proposed the research goal and approach, and engaged in devising novel paradigms of networking and communication models, algorithms and protocols to deal with challenges in mobile ad hoc networks by looking at the microbiological characteristics as the source of inspiration, such as the cellular adaptability to varying environments, inherent robustness to failures and damages, self-organization, evolvability, etc.

Detailed contributions include:

+ Developed a non-cooperative game-theoretic framework for energy-efficient and reliable cooperative networking and communications, and proposed a relay selection decision-making algorithm based on stochastic learning approach for achieving the Nash equilibrium performance of the cooperative network.
+ Proposed an adaptive beacon control scheme by combining the reinforcement learning theory and the epidemic routing protocol to enhance the performance of vehicular ad hoc networks in terms of both the reliability and the resource conservation.
+ Developed an adaptive probabilistic infection and an adaptive limited-time forwarding mechanisms for epidemic broadcasting in vehicular ad hoc networks, and proposed an adaptive vehicular epidemic routing method by combining the epidemic mechanism with the attractor selection model to achieve a good trade-off between reachability and efficiency of message dissemination.
