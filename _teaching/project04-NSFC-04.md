**Key Student Member** established the overall project proposal in terms of the data-driven pattern recognition of massive connected vehicles\' mobility and demands on network resources, the joint scheduling optimization of 5G-oriented computation and communication resources for massive connected vehicles, the spatio-temporal state evaluation and mobility optimization of massive connected vehicles, and the system performance evaluation based on simulation models and field tests, proposed the research goal and approach, and engaged in devising novel models, algorithms and protocols based on swarm intelligence to tackle the challenging issues of cooperative communication-computation resources scheduling and optimization for connected vehicles.

Detailed contributions include:

+ Proposed a reliability-oriented stochastic optimization model based on the dynamic programming for computation offloading in the presence of the deadline constraint on application execution.
+ Analytically formulated the transient inter-vehicle connectivity under Nakagami fading channels and developed a stochastic model of the session-layer throughput performance evaluation of the inter-vehicle link based on DSRC.
+ Developed a robust optimization model for assigning content data traffic among different cooperative transmission paths, where the objective is to minimize the maximum likelihood of unsuccessful content transmissions over a cooperative vehicular ad hoc network.
