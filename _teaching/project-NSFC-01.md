**Student Member** participating in the establishment of the project proposal and collaborated with the connected vehicles group of the CVIS&SC Lab to investigate the issues of vehicle platoon with mixed communication conditions, the adaptive signal control of an traffic intersection and the evacuation route planning and traffic assignment by theoretical modeling and simulations, and to develop optimization and decision-making schemes for these issues.

Detailed contributions include:

+ Developed an optimal beaconing control model as well as its algorithm for adaptive vehicular broadcasting networks, and conducted simulation-based experiments to investigate the performance of vehicular broadcasting under the beaconing control.
+ Developed a vehicle collision avoidance algorithm based on dynamic evluation of inter-vehicle distance as well as its prototype module in an Android OS-based vehicular terminal to support the vehicular safety forwarning based on vehicular communications.
+ Proposed a dynamic travel time prediction framework based on the autoregressive neural network model as well as a vehicle route guidance method by combining the travel time prediction with the dynamic programming and the Dijkstra-Yen $$k$$-shortest algorithm.
