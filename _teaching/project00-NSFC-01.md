**Student Member** collaborated with the connected vehicles group of the CVIS&SC Lab to investigate the issues of vehicle platoon with mixed communication conditions, the adaptive signal control of an traffic intersection and the evacuation route planning and traffic assignment by theoretical modeling and simulations, and to develop optimization and decision-making schemes for these issues.

Detailed contributions include:

+ Developed a stochastic model of chain collision of a heterogeneous vehicle platoon with consideration of car-following dynamics and partial inter-vehicle communication penetration to support simulation-based analysis on the comprehensive safety of the platoon.
+ Applied neural computing principle and fuzzy decision-making technique to realize an adaptive control of a traffic intersection, and developed the algorithm prototype as well as a joint simulation platform based on the integration of VISSIM and MATLAB engine.
+ Proposed a topology generation scheme for traffic evacuation based on the Dijkstra-Yen $$k$$-shortest algorithm and a particle swarm optimization-based algorithm for realizing the traffic assignment on the evacuation network.
