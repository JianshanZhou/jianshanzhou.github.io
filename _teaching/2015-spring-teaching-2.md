**Student Member** participating in the establishment of the project proposal and collaborated with the connected vehicles group of the CVIS&SC Lab to develop mathematical models, algorithm prototypes and on-board functional modules for effective support of vehicular safety warning and the real-time dynamic route guidance with Internet of Vehicles.

Detailed contributions include:

+ Developed an optimal beaconing control model as well as its algorithm for adaptive vehicular broadcasting networks, and conducted simulation-based experiments to investigate the performance of vehicular broadcasting under the beaconing control.
+ Developed a vehicle collision avoidance algorithm based on dynamic evluation of inter-vehicle distance as well as its prototype module in an Android OS-based vehicular terminal to support the vehicular safety forwarning based on vehicular communications.
+ Proposed a dynamic travel time prediction framework based on the autoregressive neural network model as well as a vehicle route guidance method by combining the travel time prediction with the dynamic programming and the Dijkstra-Yen $k$-shortest algorithm.
