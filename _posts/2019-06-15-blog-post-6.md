> In this project, I would like to show how to design as well as implement a general nonlinear constrained optimization algorithm that can be deployed for solving a wide variety of nonlinear constrained optimization problems in science and engineering fields. To be specific, the nonlinear optimization algorithm integrates the well-known bio-inspired algorithm **Particle Swarm Optimzation** with the framework of **Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier Method**. This project follows the **Model-based Design** approach by using **MATLAB** and demonstrates how powerful MATLAB is to help us rapidly design, prototype, and deploy our optimization application and the advantage of the Model-based Design approach in transforming the optimization theory to application code.

## Introduction: Philosophy of Model-based Design based on MATLAB

Model-Based Design is a methodological approach that treats a system model as an executable specification throughout development. Following the model-bsaed design, we can design and simulate both the system- and component-level models and automatically transform the algorithm design to the application product-type code. Besides, we can continuously, early and often test, verify and validate our code by maintaining the traceability from requirements to design to code. It has been widely used in the fields of designing complex control, signal processing and communication systems. Currently, **MATLAB** as well as its product family (such as simulink, stateflow) has provided a powerful tool chain to implement the model-based design approach. The basic workflow of model-based design using MATLAB is given in the following figure for the sake of example.

![Model-based Design Workflow][1]

Here, I apply the model-based design approach to solve numerical optimization problems for the sake of demonstraion of the model-based design philosophy. Specifically, as given in the figure above, the workflow to prototype application code based on an optimization algorithm consists of three basic steps:

+ **DESIGN AND SIMULATION**: In the early stage, we need to abstract the optimization problem by appropriately mathematically modeling the system and its components. Many factors that mainly affect the system behavior/performance should be well identified and defined and incorporated into our mathematical model. Here, MATLAB/simulink can help us achieve the design and simulation of our target system. More importantly, we can rapidly develop as well as test our optimization algorithm by programming the code in MATLAB.

+ **IMPLEMENTATION**: After the algorithm design and testing in MATLAB code, we can use the automatic code generation tool, **MATLAB Coder**, provided by MATLAB to generate the application code like C/C++ from the MATLAB code. Besides, the generated code can also be optimized and combined with our hand-written code in terms of code efficiency and performance.

+ **TEST AND VERIFICATION**: We can continuously test and verify our product code even in MATLAB via the mex APIs that can be generated automatically by MATLAB Coder. The mex APIs allow the interaction between the MATLAB code and the C/C++ code. Once the system requirements change, we can effectively captures the changed requirements in the MATLAB code, and re-generate the application code from the MATLAB code. Continuous test and verification can be performed by virtual code integration and software/hardware-in-the-loop.

## Theory of General Nonlinear Constrained Optimization based on Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier Method

In this section, before actually implementing the optimization code, we need to model our optimization problem as mentioned in the first section above. Generally speaking, a wide range of engineering, scientific, and operational applications involve nonlinear constrained optimization (NCO). Basically, we can construct a **NCO problem** by a general form as follows

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\min _{x} f(x)} \\ {\text {s.t.}\left\{\begin{array}{c}{g_{i}(x) \geq 0, i=1,2, \cdots, m} \\ {h_{j}(x)=0, j=1,2, \cdots, l}\end{array}\right.}\end{array}
$$

which contains the nonlinear objective function $f(x)$, the nonlinear inequality and equality constraint functions, $g_{i}(x)$ and $h_{i}(x)$. 

To solve the general NCO problem above, I resort to the well-known **Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier Method** that has certain similarities to penalty methods as both types of the methods transform the constrained optimization problems to a series of unconstrained optimization problems by adding a penalty term to the objective function. Differently, the augmented Lagrangian multiplier method adds another term that is designed to mimic a Lagrange multiplier. The augmented Lagrangian method proposes the following unconstrained objective function:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{
L(x, w, v, \sigma)=f(x)+\frac{1}{2 \sigma} \sum_{j=1}^{m}\left\{\left[\max \left(0, w_{j}-\sigma g_{j}(x)\right)\right]^{2}-w_{j}^{2}\right\}} \\ \qquad{-\sum_{j=1}^{l} v_{j} h_{j}(x)+\frac{\sigma}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{l} h_{j}^{2}(x)} \\ {w=\left[w_{1}, w_{2}, \cdots, w_{m}\right]^{\mathrm{T}}} \\ {v=\left[v_{1}, v_{2}, \cdots, v_{l}\right]^{\mathrm{T}}}\end{array}
$$

where $w$ and $v$ are two column vectors containing Lagrange multipliers associated with the inequality and equaility constraints. Given $k$ as the interation, the Lagrange multipliers can be updated by 

$$
\begin{aligned} w_{i}(k+1) &=\max \left(0, w_{i}(k)-\sigma g_{i}(x(k))\right), i=1,2, \cdots, m \\ v_{j}(k+1) &=v_{j}(k)-\sigma h_{j}(x(k)), j=1,2, \cdots, l \end{aligned}
$$

Then, I illustrate the overall framework of the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier Method in the following figure.

![Framework of Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier Method][2]

In order to solve the unconstrained optimization problem with the Lagrange objective function as follows, I propose the algorithm based on **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**, a well-known biologically inspired optimization mechanism that is quite effective for unconstrained global optimization.

$$
\min_{x} L(x, w, v, \sigma)
$$

That is, once given the previous solution point $x(k-1)$ as an initial point as well as the multipliers $w(k)$ and $v(k)$, we can use PSO to solve the unconstrained optimization model to obtain a new point $x(k)$ as $x(k)\leftarrow \text{PSO solver }({{argmin}_{x} L(x, w(k), v(k), \sigma),x_0=x(k-1)})$

## Algorithm Design and Implementation in MATLAB Code 

Based on the theory of the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier Method introduced above, I first design and implement the algorithm components in MATLAB, which mainly include the PSO algorithm and the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier algorithm.

![MATLAB code of ALM][4]

The MATLAB code as well as the test code for the PSO algorithm and the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier algorithm can be found in my GitHub repository **[Optimization-Algorithm-Design-and-Implementation][5]**.

## Test and Verification of MATLAB Code

As aforementioned, I apply the PSO algorithm to solve a series of unconstrained optimization problems derived from the augmented Lagrangian objective. The performance of the PSO will significantly affect the overall performance of the augmented Lagrangian multiplier method. Thus, I first test and verify the MATLAB code of the PSO algorithm. To do this, I refer to two examples given in MATLAB, one of which is to locate the global minimum point of the No. fifth De Jong's function (which is a well-known benchmark function with multimodal local minimum points and very sharp drops on the flat surface), and the other is to find the global the maximum of an electromagnetic interference pattern. 

### Test PSO on minimization of the 5th De Jong's function

The test result can be shown in the following figure where it indicates that the PSO can find the global minimum point at ( -31.9785,-31.9783).

![test PSO1][6]

### Test PSO on problem of electromagnetic interference pattern maximization

To further test and verify the MATLAB code of the PSO, I consider a more complex optimization problem in which we need to find the maximum electromagnetic interference pattern. Generally, the electric field due to source $i$ measured in the direction of polarization at point $x$ and time $t$ can be represented as

$$
E_{i}=\frac{A_{i}}{d_{i}(x)} \sin \left(\phi_{i}+\omega\left(t-d_{i}(x) / c\right)\right)
$$

where $\phi_i$ is the phase at time zero for source $i$, $c$ is the speed of light, $\omega$ is the frequency of the light, $A_i$ is the amplitude of source $i$, and $d_i(x)$ is the distance from source $i$ to $x$. The overall optimization problem can be modeled as

$$
\max _{x, y} I(x, y)
$$

which is subject to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\left(x-x_{\mathrm{cl}}\right)^{2}+\left(y-y_{c 1}\right)^{2} \leq r_{1}^{2}} \\ {\left(x-x_{c 2}\right)^{2}+\left(y-y_{c 2}\right)^{2} \leq r_{2}^{2}} \\ {\left(x-x_{c 3}\right)^{2}+\left(y-y_{c 3}\right)^{2} \leq r_{3}^{2}} \\ {-0.5 \leq x \leq 3.5} \\ {-2 \leq y \leq 3}\end{array}
$$

where the wave intensity ($I$) falls off as we move away from the source proportional to $1/d_i(x)$. $(x_{cn},y_{cn})$ and $r_n$ are the coordinates and aperture radius of the $n^{th}$ point source, respectively.

The relative functions scripts can be found in MATLAB indeed. Next, we can visualize such an objective function as follows

![objfunc][7]

The contour plot of the objective function is

![contour][8]

It can be seen from the figures above that the objective function is a multimodal with many very sharp drops, which poses a challenge for locating a global maximum point. Indeed, I have tried to use the **fmincon** function with **SQP** algorithm provided by MATLAB to solve this strong NCO problem while the algorithm failed in finding the global solution (See the following result).

![comparison][9]

Now, I apply the designed PSO to do the optimization within the feasible region and it is shown that the proposed PSO can successfully find the global maximum point. This means that the PSO is quite effective to solve the global optimization.

![comparison2][10]

### Test overall algorithm on problem of electromagnetic interference pattern maximization

It should be noted that in the above section, I have tested the PSO algorithm by treating the problem of electromagnetic interference pattern maximization as an unconstrained optimization problem. Now I take into account the strict constraint conditions. I combine the PSO and the augmented Lagrangian multiplier method to solve the NCO, the result of which is given in the following figure. We can also see that our augmented Lagrangian multiplier method can successfully solve the global optimal point with satisfying the constraints, while, by comparison, the MATLAB **fmincon** function can only find the local optimal point. The result indicates that the MATLAB code is valid and can properly solve a complex NCO problem.

![comparison3][11]

## Automatic C/C++ Code Generation From MATLAB Code 

Now, as long as I successfully test and verify our MATLAB code, we can also use the **MATLAB coder** to automatically generate the application product code, i.e., C/C++, from the MATLAB code implemented above. 

![ccode][12]

Now, I can also generate the **mex APIs** by MATLAB coder and use the APIs to test, verify and compare the C/C++ code performance in MATLAB environment. By Comparison, both the MATLAB code and the generated C/C++ code can solve the complex NCO in our expected manner, while the C/C++ code can run much faster than the MATLAB code. From the following compared result, we can see that the **speed-up ratio of 4.1882** can be achieved by the C/C++ code on average.

![spee-up][13]

## Deployment of Generated C/C++ Code

After testing and verifying the C/C++ code, we can integrate the code into our other project. Here, I create a C/C++ project in **Visual Studio Community 2019** to solve the above NCO model for the sake of example. The VS community 2019 project can be accessed in my [repository][14]. The generated C/C++ code of the optimization algorithm can be easily included into the VS project with few modifications. Here, I apply the code to solve 1000 NCO problems with different parameter settings, and we can obeserve that the C/C++ code can solve each NCO problem within about 192ms.

## Conclusion

In this project, I have presented the theory of a general nonlinear constrained optimization method, **Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier Method**, which is also combined with a representative bio-inspired unconstrained optimization algorithm, **PSO**, as well as show how to rapidly prototype the optimization algorithm in MATLAB. Using MATLAB coder, we can easily automatically generate the application product code like C/C++ from the MATLAB code that can be well integrated into our application project. Continuous test and verification can also be performed here. The idea follows **Model-based Design** approach, in which the underlying philosophy is that much more effort can be saved from unnecessary hand-writing code and put into design and innovation of model and algorithm.
