> This demo project shows how to implement a **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**-based **Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC)** for **a vehicle platoon equipped with wireless communication** and traveling on a curved road, where the leading car uses sensor fusion to sense the traffic environment and all the cars in the platoon use vehicular communication to exchange their real-time mobility information. Specifically, I develop the simulation and conduct the analysis using MATLAB/Simulink.

## Introduction

Efficient control of a vehicle platoon can be a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of the traffic environment. Generally, simulation-based design, test and verification can play a quite important role in the early system implementation stage. Hence, in this project, I would like to show how to develop a vehicle platoon that is assumed to be equipped with wireless communication and hwo to design the system simulation model for controller desgin, test and verification. For the sake of demonstration, I assume that our focused platoon consists of 8 cars where the leader is equipped with vision and radar sensors and can use **Kalman Filter** for sensor fusion, while the other 7 following cars can only rely on vehicular communication to sense the real-time position and velocity of their front car in order to make a driving decision. In this way, the overall platoon control belongs to the **leader-follower pattern**. The overall simulation is developed in Simulink as follows:

## MPC-based ACC Controller Design

Using vehicular communication, each car is able to share its real-time position and velocity with its rear car, such that the rear car can estimate the **safe distance** $D_{\mathrm{safe}}$ by calculating the **Relative distance** and the **Relative velocity** between them. Mathematically, The safe distance between a front and a rear cars is defined as

$$
D_{s a f e}=D_{d e f a u l t}+T_{g a p} \cdot V_{x}
$$

where $V_{x}$ is the longitudinal velocity of the ego car.

Furthermore, the MPC-based ACC design needs to solve an optimization problem that can be formulated by tracking the driver-set velocity subject to the relative safe distance constraint and the bound conditions on the acceleration. The optimization model can be 

$$
\begin{array}{ll}{\underset{u}{\operatorname{minimize}}} & {\left|V-V_{s e t}\right|^{2}} \\ {\text { subject to }} & {D_{\text {relative}}-D_{\text {safe}} \geq 0} \\ {} & {-3 \leq u \leq 2}\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
&\mathrm{minimize}_{u}\quad {\left|V-V_{s e t}\right|^{2}}\\
&\mathrm{subject to}\quad {D_{\text {relative}}-D_{\text {safe}} \geq 0}\\
&\qquad\qquad {-3 \leq u \leq 2}
\end{split}
$$

Here, the vehicular communication and the MPC-based ACC controller are combined and their simulation model can be implemented in Simulink as follows. We can refer to the **Model Predictive Control Toolbox** of MATLAB to achieve this simulation model.

## Vehicle Dynamics Model

By resorting to the **Automated Driving Toolbox** provided in Simulink block library, we can easily design the vehicle dynamics model like the following one

## Simulation and Analysis

Referring to the [example][4] of Adaptive Cruise Control with Sensor Fusion provided by MATLAB, I use the same synthetic traffic scenario data for testing the closed-loop platoon control system. The following demo illustrates the real-time position and velocity of each car in the platoon. It can be seen that (1) the leader can efficiently adapt its longitudinal velocity to the external disturbance and (2) each follower can also track the relative safe distance between themselves and their front cars.

Due to the explicity relative safe distance constraint, the MPC-based contoller can aggressively behave in adapting the relative distance beetween any two successive cars in the platoon so as to efficeintly avoid chain collision.
