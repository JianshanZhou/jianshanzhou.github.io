> In this experiment, I have used the **Image Acquisition Toolbox** provided by MATLAB 2019a to acquire live 3D point cloud raw data from a Velodyne LiDAR Sensor that is mounted on the top of a car and show how to pre-process the raw lidar data such as performing segmentation and clustering of the lidar data, and then detecting obstacles by bounding box.

## LiDAR Sensor Data Acquisition

In my experiment, the Velodyne Puck (VLP-16) sensor is adopted. With help of the Image Acquisition Toolbox of MATLAB 2019a, I can easily perform the acquisition of Lidar sensor data stream in MATLAB.

By doing this, I have recorded $10000$ frames of lidar data from the VLP-16 sensor. The following live 3D point cloud visualization shows the profile of the sensor data stream.

## Pre-processing and Obstacle Detection

To exact the objects of interest, I need to pre-process the raw data by performing the segmentation and clustering on the sensor data. To be specific, I can segment the lidar data into some objects such as the ground plane, the ego car and the obstacles. By using the function **pcsegdist** of MATLAB, I can further classify the 3D point clouds belonging to an obstacle into a cluster and then bound the cluster with a box. The following animation demonstrates the 3D bounding box result.
