> In this project, we would like to demostrate the implementation of forward collision warning (FCW) based on V2V communication. This demonstration shows how the integration of the FCW algorithm and vehicular communication can leverage the driving safety in an autonomous manner.

FCW plays a key role in a genearl Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Using FCW, a driver can be informed of potential forward collisions ahead of time so that he or she is able to take emergency barking to avoid or mitigate collisions timely. To efficiently implement FCW algorithm, two key factors should be taken into account:

1. Accurately and reliably identify the critical conditions with which potential forward collisions are likely to occur;  
2. Warn the driver in time when potential forward crashes are identified, or reduce the severity of unavoidable collisions as much as possible (by reducing the speed of collisions).

In our project, we combine the vehicular communication with two types of well-known vehicular sensors, namely, the high-precision on-board Global Positioning System (PGPS) and the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), to design the FCW system. Compared to conventional FCW systems that are implemented by using other additional vehicular sensors like Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Sonar, etc., vehicular communication has two significant advantages: i) The perception of nearby cars' real-time kinematics parameters (such as speed and acceleration) and positions can be more flexibly realized by V2V communication. The road conditions such as weather usually have a great impact on the performance of camera and LiDAR rather than vehicular communication. ii) The information interaction between vehicles and between vehicles and road-side units can be performed at a much larger distance, which implies that the over-the-horizon applications are naturally supported via vehicular communication to enhance the traffic safety in some special scenarios like unsignalized intersections, on-/off-ramps and some other curved roads where the conventional sensors may be infeasible for danger warning. At this point, the FCW system using vehicular communication can have many advantages over the traditional FCW systems.

## Introduction of Vehicular Platform
The essential on-board units required to implement our FCW system are detailed as follows:

1.**High-precision GPS**: NovAtel@TM GPS702-GG (dual antenna) and FLEXG2-V2-GENERIC Receiver. The on-board GPS unit is of differential GPS type, which can be used to collect the real-time data on the position and speed of the car.
2. **On-board IMU**: MEMSIC@TM VG440. The IMU is used to measure the acceleration/acceleration rate and yaw angle/yaw rate of the car over time. The IMU and the GPS can be combined and the sensor data can be fused by using Kalman filter to determine the real-time pose of the car.
3. **Vehicular Communication Terminal**: IEEE 802.11p-based DSRC terminal. In our project, the Atheros AR5414 chipset (with the driver of ath5k) is used to realize the DSRC-based vehicular communication, which is available on miniPCI cards. The WLAN driver provided is configured to the DSRC control channel at 5.89 GHz. 
4. **Vehicular GUI**: the overall vehicular graphical user interface is constructed by using Qt, a well-known free and open-source widget toolkit. On the vehicular GUI, we visualize the host and the front cars' relative positions and speeds, and display the warning information for the driver.

The overall architecture for the implementation of the vehicular platform integrating the aforementioned components is given in the following figures.

## From Design of FCW Logic to Implementation
In our project, we follow **model-based design** approach, a well-known methodology for developing embedded software, to realize the FCW algorithm. In the early design stage, we model the FCW system with **MATLAB/Simulink** and perform the system simulation for the verification and validation of the developed FCW algorithm. Then, we **automatically generate C++ code** from the FCW prototype. The generated C++ code is then integrated with the other component projects (GPS/IMU/Vehicular Communication) deployed on the vehicular platform.

The workflow from the design of our FCW logic to its rapid prototyping and implementation is illustrated as follows.

## Field-Test Demo
We also test the FCW system in the actual car-following scenario where there exist a leading car and a following car. The leader and the follower can exchange their data via vehicular communication and the sensor data are collected by the on-board sensors over time. In this demo, when the front car suddently stops, the driver is immediately informed of the emergency stopping of the front car by the warning message shown on the GUI and the follower can also brake timely to avoid the potential front collision.

## Conclusion
From the field-test demo, some remarks can be concluded: First, the FCW system can really benefit from the use of vehicular communication due to the real-time information interaction between vehicles. Second, vehicular communication is promising for not only the enhancement of driving safety but also the autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and some other autonomous vehicular applications. In the future, we expect that many other safety-critical applications, such as chain collision warning (CCA) systems, cooperative car following or lane changing, etc., can also be implemented by the deployment of vehicular communication.
