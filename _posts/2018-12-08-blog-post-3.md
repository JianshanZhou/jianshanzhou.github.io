In this blog, I will show the basic concept of the well-known swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithm, called particle swarm optimization (PSO). The basic PSO is implemented in MATLAB for the sake of demonstration and an application demo is given in which I will show how to solve a basic nonlinear constrained optimization model by using PSO.
