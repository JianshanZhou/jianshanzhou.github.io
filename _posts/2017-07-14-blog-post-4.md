In this blog, the basic components that make up this vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) simulation are outlined with python and a demo is also given.



The objective of this simulation project developed in Python is to explore implementation of a simple epidemic-based routing mechanism designed to support reliable message dissemination in vehicular ad-hoc networks. In this project, the simulation can be carried out under different mobility by adopting different distributions of vehicle speed and inter-vehicle space, which provides several typical traffic scenarios for studying the epidemic routing mechanism. In addition, I remark that the basic mobility model used here is based on the well-known intelligent dreiver model (IDM), the detailed mathematical representation of the IDM can be referred to in the WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model, and the default mobility parameters involved are set according to existing liturature. A demo can be as follows.
