We have developed key technological components including V2X on-board units (OBU) and road-side units (RSU) products, which support a wide range of vehicle safety and non-safety applications based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and/or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. As follows, several representative V2X application situations where our key V2X products have been deployed, such as V2V-based collision avoidance at an intersection or car-following control, are illustrated for the sake of technological demonstration and validation. Besides, the key technologies involved are also outlined.
