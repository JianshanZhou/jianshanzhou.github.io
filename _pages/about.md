I received his B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in traffic information engineering and control from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2013, 2016 and 2020, respectively. From 2017 to 2018, he was also a visiting research fellow with the school of informatics and engineering, University of Sussex, United Kingdom. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Beijing Key Laboratory for Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure Systems and Safety Control (CVIS&SC Lab), Beijing, China. In 2018, I was also awarded the **Beihang Top-ten Outstanding PhD Student**. I have wide research interests, mainly covering *intelligent transportation systems* (ITS), *cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems* (CIVS), *connected vehicles* (CV), *mobile cloud/edge computing*, *bio-inspired computing*, *swarm intelligence*, among which **cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems** and **connected vehicles** are my core research areas. In these areas, I have published over 10 journal and conference papers and more than 5 Chinese patents.
