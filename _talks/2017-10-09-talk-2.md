Biological systems are known to self-adapt and re-organize to achieve global efficiency (optimization). This talk will start with some useful insights into the crossdisciplinary research of bio-inspired communication, networking and traffic control. 

To be specific, existing challenges and some representative bio-inspired solutions will be discussed in order to capture the significance and potentials of biology approaches into networking problems. A mathematical model in the field of computational biology, called cellular attractor selection model, will be introduced to highlight the adaptive behavior of cells in stochastically changing environments. Following this model, an extended attractor selection model is proposed to further capture the dynamics of adaptive attractor selection in a highdimension space. At the end, some successful application cases based on the proposed adaptive attractor selection model will be discussed.
