In this talk, the issue on the design of a robust energy-efficient solution for multiple-inputâ€“multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions in cognitive vehicular networks will be discussed in detail. Specifically, the optimization of the energy efficiency (EE) of SUs is formulated with the uncertainty of channel state information (CSI). To deal with this model, the robust interference constraint is transformed into a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, this talk will also introduce a feasible ascent direction approach proposed to reduce the optimization problem into a sequential linearly constrained semidefinite program, which leads to a distributed iterative optimization algorithm for deriving the robust and optimal beamforming. The feasibility and convergence of the proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed, and the final experimental results are also presented to show the strength of the proposed algorithm over some conventional schemes in terms of the achieved EE performance and robustness.
