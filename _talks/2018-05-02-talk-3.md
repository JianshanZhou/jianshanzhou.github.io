Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have a potential to boost vehicular telematics and infotainment applications, where a key and challenging issue is the design of robust and efficient vehicular content transmissions to combat the lossy inter-vehicle links. In this presentation, a robust optimization of content transmissions over cooperative VANETs is focused on. 

A stochastic model for estimation of time-varying inter-vehicle distance is first derived, which is dependent on the vehicle real-time kinematics and the distribution of the initial space headway. With this model, a transient inter-vehicle connectivity assuming Nakagami fading channels for the physical (PHY) layer is analytically formulated. Also, the contention nature of the medium access control (MAC) layer is modeled, which enables evaluating the throughput achieved by each vehicle equipped with dedicated short-range communication (DSRC). Combining these models, a closed-formed expression for the upper bound of the probability of failure in intact-content transmissions over an inter-vehicle link is derived. Based upon this theoretical bound, a robust optimization model is developed, where the objective is to minimize the maximum likelihood of unsuccessful content transmissions over a set of cooperative inter-vehicle links. In this presentation, simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the substantial advantage of the proposed robust optimization solution over some other comparable schemes in terms of transmission efficiency and reception reliability.
