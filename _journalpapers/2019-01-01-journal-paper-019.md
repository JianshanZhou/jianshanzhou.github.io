**Abstract**: Computation offloading is critical for mobile applications that are sensitive to computational power, while dynamic and random nature of vehicular networks makes it challenging to guarantee the reliability of vehicular computation offloading. In this letter, we propose a reliability-oriented stochastic optimization model based on the dynamic programming for computation offloading in the presence of the deadline constraint on application execution. Specifically, a theoretical lower bound of the expected reliability of computation offloading is derived, and then an optimal data transmission scheduling mechanism is proposed to maximize the lower bound with consideration of randomness in vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Experimental results demonstrate that our mechanism can outperform the conventional scheme and benefits vehicular computation offloading in terms of reliability performance in stochastic situations.
