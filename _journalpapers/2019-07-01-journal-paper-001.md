**Abstract**: In vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANETs), the proliferation of wireless communication will give rise to the heterogeneous access environment where network selection becomes significant. Motivated by the self-adaptive paradigm of cellular attractors, this paper regards an individual communication as a cell, so that we can apply the revised attractor selection model to induce each connected vehicle. Aiming at improving the Quality of Service (QoS), we presented the bio-inspired handover decision-making mechanism. In addition, we employ the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for any vehicle to choose an access network. This paper proposes a novel framework where the bio-inspired mechanism is combined with TOPSIS. In a dynamic and random mobility environment, our method achieves the coordination of performance of heterogeneous networks by guaranteeing the efficient utilization and fair distribution of network resources in a global sense. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method performs better when compared with conventional schemes.
