**Abstract**: The emergence of vehicular networking enables distributed cooperative computation among nearby vehicles and infrastructures to achieve various applications that may need to handle mass data by a short deadline. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental problems of a cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system (CVIS): how does vehicular communication and networking affect the benefit gained from cooperative computation in the CVIS and what should a reliability-optimal cooperation be? We develop an analytical framework of reliability-oriented cooperative computation optimization, considering the dynamics of vehicular communication and computation. To be specific, we propose stochastic modeling of V2V and V2I communications, incorporating effects of the vehicle mobility, channel contentions and fading, and theoretically derive the probability of successful data transmission. We also formulate and solve an execution time minimization model to obtain the success probability of application completion with the constrained computation capacity and application requirements. By combining these models, we develop constrained optimizations to maximize the coupled reliability of communication and computation by optimizing the data partitions among different cooperators. Numerical results confirm that vehicular applications with a short deadline and large processing data size can better benefit from the cooperative computation rather than non-cooperative solutions.
