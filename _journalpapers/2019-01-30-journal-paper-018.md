**Abstract**: Video transmission in Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is an emerging technology which utilizes the multimedia inside and outside vehicles itself through Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). In IoVs, traditional multi-hop routing protocols are not adaptive to mobile environment, especially the high-mobility driving environment in which vehicles need to accomplish video transmission under high quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a multi-hop routing protocol for video transmission in IoVs based on cellular attractor selection (MRVT-CAS). We design a packet generation method for MRVT-CAS and use Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to construct the candidate set of next-hop selection. Then we map the expression of different genes in cell to selection of different next-hop nodes, and employ the mechanics of cellular attractor selection to select next-hop node. Moreover, we present a real-time feedback process to improve self-adaptability and robustness of routing protocol. Our simulation study compares MRVT-CAS with other routing protocols to evaluate performance of video transmission. The simulation results demonstrate the performance improvement over traditional methods, in terms of reachability, delay, stability and frame loss rate.
