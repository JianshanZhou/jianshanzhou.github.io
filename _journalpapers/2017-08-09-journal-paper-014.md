**Abstract**: We present a bio-inspired unicast routing protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks which uses the cellular attractor selection mechanism to select next hops. The proposed unicast routing protocol based on attractor selecting (URAS) is an opportunistic routing protocol, which is able to change itself adaptively to the complex and dynamic environment by routing feedback packets. We further employ a multiattribute decision-making strategy, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution, to reduce the number of redundant candidates for next-hop selection, so as to enhance the performance of attractor selection mechanism. Once the routing path is found, URAS maintains the current path or finds another better path adaptively based on the performance of current path, that is, it can self-evolution until the best routing path is found. Our simulation study compares the proposed solution with the stateof-the-art schemes, and shows the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed routing protocol and the significant performance improvement, in terms of packet delivery, end-to-end delay, and congestion, over the conventional method.
