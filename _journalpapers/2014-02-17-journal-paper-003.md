**Abstract**: Dynamic nature of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) creates great challenges for message dissemination. To satisfy the high reliability and low delivery latency requirements for safety applications in VANETs, a dynamic epidemic broadcasting model is presented in this paper. On the basis of the ordinary differential equations, the proposed optimal control scheme is analyzed to understand the epidemic broadcasting properties, which include the message delivery probability, the expected delivery latency, and the number of copies. The correctness of the theoretical analyses is confirmed by simulations, and the experiment results prove the efficiency of the optimal epidemic broadcasting model.
