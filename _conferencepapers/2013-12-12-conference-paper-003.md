**Abstract**: Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) standards have been defined as the physical and MAC layers in the context of vehicular communications. In this work, the implementations of IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609-family standards developed for DSRC are reviewed firstly, then a novel self-adaptive vehicle to vehicle(V2V) Communication System based on 802.11p is designed in details, which relates the required rebroadcasting frequency to both the underlying vehicular traffic and packet loss characteristics and is able to dynamically adapt its broadcasting frequency to variations in vehicular traffic and network topology in order to reduce the probability of vehicle collision. The real communication experiments are set up and the performances of this proposed system are examined and analyzed in the context of V2V communication for some real different environmental conditions. Results show the notable efficiency and self-adaptability of the system in real world.
