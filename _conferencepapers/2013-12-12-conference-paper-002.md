**Abstract**: With advances in connected vehicle technology, real-time vehicle route guidance systems gradually become indispensable equipments for drivers. Conventional route guidance systems are designed to direct a vehicle along the shortest path from the origin to the destination without considering the dynamic traffic information. Therefore the state-of-the-art route guidance systems incorporate real-time traffic information to find better paths. So, this paper presents a novel approach to realize the real-time vehicle route guidance. It focuses on the way to determine the optimal route based on the dynamic road segments division and the traditional Dijkstra algorithm. This approach divides the road to sub-sections with the traffic information, so the state of each segment can be easily figured out (i.e. average speed or average travel time). Then a dynamic road network graph can be drawn out. And traditional Dijkstra algorithm can find optimal route on it. A simulation is implemented to show optimal route at different time. It also compares with the traditional Dijkstra algorithm and the result is validated.
