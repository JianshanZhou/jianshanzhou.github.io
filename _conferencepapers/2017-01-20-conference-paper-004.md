**Abstract**: As an important member of IOV, vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) play a key role for many vehicular applications, which significantly rely on the vehicular routing. However, the frequently changed topology leads to great challenge to the routing protocol. In this work, inspired by the mechanism of cellular adaptive responses in a changing environment, called cellular attractor selection, we propose a novel bio-inspired unicast routing protocol, which can adapt vehicular message forwarding to the changing topology to guarantee the routing efficiency and reliability. The experimental results exhibit the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method and the significantly improved performance over the conventional routing protocol.
